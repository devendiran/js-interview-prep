1. Merge Sort

2. Decode 3[abc2[aa]] -> abcaaaaabcaaaaabcaaaa

3. min length substring input -> 'Adobebca', 'abc' ; output -> 'bca'

4. min frog jump [2,3,0,1,4] -> dp problem

5. two sum, three sum pair 

6. find the min sort required for an arrya to be sorted

7. min value in each level of the binary three

8. sub tree count with equal number of zeros and one

9. print zigzap spiral of linked list

10. Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained. Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.
    Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}
       exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
    First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4, 
    second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.

    Output: 5
    There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.  

11. Find path to a node and print the same if path not found return -1
    Each node has unique ids where as root node as id as zero and there may be multiple root node but the child ids will be always unique
